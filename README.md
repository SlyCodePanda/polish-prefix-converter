# polish-prefix-converter
Converts polish prefix to infix notation

This project was for a university assignment created on the 14th of May 2017.

The main issue I came across when writting this was figuring out how to insert the brackets in the output of the infix notation.
e.g. if input was “* - 5 6 7”, then the ouput given is “5 – 6 * 7 = -7”. Instead of output being “(5 – 6) * 7 = -7”.
At the time of uploading this, I have yet to correct this error.
